JC-Rest is a collection of RESTful services for Java Content Repositories (JCR). These services can return JSON, XML, and ATOM. In addition, HTML can be returned with the use of FTL templates. JC-Rest also includes a lightweight repository browser built with YUI.

Check out my blog post on JC-Rest [here](http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sjohnson/?p=24). It gives a broader overview and background on JC-Rest along with a few examples.

10/28/08 - Update: I uploaded new WARs to reflect the new services/browser I mentioned in this [post](http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sjohnson/?p=26). I also checked in a few files that were missing to take advantage of these for those of you building it locally.

11/12/08 - Update: I have added [enunciate](http://enunciate.codehaus.org) to JC-Rest to generate JAX-RS/JAXB documentation (HTML). See this [post](http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sjohnson/?p=30) for details.
